The project is currently being hosted by CODDII(Conference of Directors and Deans of Computer Engineering).   

## What is this project about
The main goal of Reposearch is making a unified search engine for computer science theses in Spain.   

For this project, the following modules were developed:  
1. **Web Search Interface**: Web search page built in React.
2. **Search API Integration**: Implemented search functionality using FastAPI.
3. **Automated Data Refresh**: Automated web scraping and cron job scripts to update the database.
4. **Automated Thesis Processing**: More scripts to automatically download theses, parse documents, and apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to convert content into vector embeddings.
5. **Enhanced Semantic Search**: Extending the api for semantic search, enabling content-based thesis discovery based on context and meaning.
